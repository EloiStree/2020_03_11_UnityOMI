I have a big problem I need to solved.  
 
Boolean is good most of the time.  
But when it is about redirect or mirror float of a controller to an other.   
That is a problem.  

So I will have to maybe do a compromise in future version.
So in plan to that I should think about the same concept of the boolean register.

Have a boolean toolbox for 80% of the app
The float toolbox for 5-15% of the app.

What I am affraid is to add the float and then to go in the Vector3 and Quaternion.
The goal is to stay universal and simple not rewrite a new coding language.
